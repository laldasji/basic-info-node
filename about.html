    <p>
        Uhm, let's see...
        <br>
        This page is about me tying whatever I want wherever I want in the name of learning web development
        <br>
        This isn't even a project, it's a practice project that I made first thing after learning a very few things about NodeJS
        <br>
        To be honest, I'm just following the curriculum of
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">The Odin Project</a>. I'm on the second last course, which, at this point, is obviously NodeJS.
