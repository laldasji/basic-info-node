        Hello my friend, I believe you've found yourself on the wrong side of the internet.
        <br>
        I don't think you'd like being here, it's just my project. If you've read so far, perhaps <b>you</b>, just like me, are on the path of learning web development, or you're already a developer, or you're a recruiter who has decided to track all my activity, the last one being <i>the least</i> likely.
    </p>
    <p>
        In any case, if you want to know more about me, here's a link to my
        <a href="https://laldasji.github.io/home" target="_blank" title="opens in new tab">
            home page.
        </a>

    <p>
        I know, vibe of this site is a bit off...
        <br>
        Some might even say the vibe is quite... clubby, if you know what I mean.
        <br>
        I'm not saying it out loud, my fellow GTA V players know what I'm getting at lol.
    </p>
